# About Me

Welcome to my profile page.

I'm Wisam,

Having completed a Full Stack Software Developer course from [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) and waiting for the result of my final project. 

I have always been interested in learning code and love learning new skills. Prior to commencing the Full Stack Software Developer course in May 2021, I had done some coding a few years back, which consisted of just some basic HTML and CSS. In 2021, I enrolled in the 5 day coding challenge with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) and loved every single moment of it, it was then that I decided it was time for a career change.
