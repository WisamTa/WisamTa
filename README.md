# About Me

Welcome to my profile page.

I'm Wisam,

I’m a DevOps Engineer focused on Kubernetes and cloud-native platforms, with hands-on experience in containerization, CI/CD, infrastructure automation, and operating applications in production environments.

I have a solid full-stack development background, which helps me collaborate effectively with application teams and design reliable deployment and operational workflows. I’m comfortable working across the full delivery lifecycle — from development and configuration to deployment, monitoring, and ongoing operations.

I’m data-driven, adaptable, and continuously improving my skills in cloud infrastructure, platform engineering, and scalable systems.
